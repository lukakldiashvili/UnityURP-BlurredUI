# Unity URP - Blurred UI Material

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3aZTWGY.png" alt="Demo" width="500">

#### Can not get blurred/translucent UI elements working? <br> This is simple, modified UI shader that blurs geometry.

*Remember to enable Opaque texture either in Camera Inspector for camera or in Pipeline asset*

**Note**:
<br>
*-Objects are blured without post processing applied to them.*
<br>
*-This shader ignores transparent objects and can not stack, meaning it can not blur UI or text underneath it.*
##### *These functionalities might be added later.*
